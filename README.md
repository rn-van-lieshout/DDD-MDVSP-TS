## Description
 
This repository contains the code for solving the Multi-Depot Vehicle Scheduling Problem with Trip Shifting. Three algorithms are implemented: 

- MIP: a mixed-integer programming model based on the fully time-expanded network
- DDD: a Dynamic Discretization Discovery Algorithm that starts with a sparse network and adds time points dynamically when needed
- BNP: a Branch-and-Price algorithm based on an extended route formulation

The code depends on CPLEX to solve all LPs and MIPs. 

All data is in the folder "dataEUC", and the source code and scriptis are in "src".
